README.txt -- hexdmp file exam utility, CRB, Sep 7, 2012

The hexdmp utility is used to examine the contents of files containing binary
data where the binary value of each byte is displayed in a pair of hexadecimal
digits. Sixteen values are shown in each row with the starting byte address on
the left. In the righthand column ASCII characters are shown if the binary
values happen to be printable ASCII characters, and a dot "." is shown as a
placeholder if the value is not a printable character. The output format
resembles that of the debug utility in DOS.

I originally wrote this program for my own use many years ago. I also used it
in programming courses I taught at University of Washington Extension.

It is my intention to use the Creative Commons (with attribution). Details to
