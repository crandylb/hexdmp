README.txt -- hexdmp file exam utility, CRB, Oct 2, 2012

The hexdmp utility is used to examine the contents of files containing binary
data where the binary value of each byte is displayed in a pair of hexadecimal
digits. Sixteen values are shown in each row with the starting byte address on
the left. In the righthand column ASCII characters are shown if the binary
values happen to be printable ASCII characters, and a dot "." is shown as a
placeholder if the value is not a printable character. Output lines that
contain all zeros are suppressed and indicated with an ellipsis "...". The
output format resembles that of the debug utility in DOS.

Use
     hexdmp filename [start [runlength]]

The first argument is the name of the file to be examined. The next two
arguments are the optional start address and run length. The options can be
either decimal or hexadecimal in the notation used for hex data in C, for
example 0x123abc.
